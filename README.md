# Google Analytics (gtag.js) Plugin

The **Google Analytics** Plugin is an extension for [Grav CMS](http://github.com/getgrav/grav).
You can easily integrate and configure Google Analytics in your Grav CMS site using the *global site tag (gtag.js)* framework and API without the need to touch any code.

> **Important:** This plugin uses the *global site tag* (*gtag.js*) framework and API for sending data to Google Analytics.
> If you prefer the deprecated *Universal Analytics* (*analytics.js*) library, please install the [Grav Google Analytics Plugin](https://github.com/escopecz/grav-ganalytics) of [John Linhart](https://github.com/escopecz) and me.

## Installation

Installing the Google Analytics plugin can be done in one of three ways: The GPM (Grav Package Manager) installation method lets you quickly install the plugin with a simple terminal command, the manual method lets you do so via a zip file, and the admin method lets you do so via the Admin Plugin.

### GPM Installation (Preferred)

To install the plugin via the [GPM](http://learn.getgrav.org/advanced/grav-gpm), through your system's terminal (also called the command line), navigate to the root of your Grav-installation, and enter:

    bin/gpm install google-analytics

This will install the Google Analytics plugin into your `/user/plugins`-directory within Grav. Its files can be found under `/your/site/grav/user/plugins/Google Analytics`.

### Manual Installation

To install the plugin manually, download the zip-version of this repository and unzip it under `/your/site/grav/user/plugins`. Then rename the folder to `Google Analytics`. You can find these files on [GitHub](https://github.com/cworreschk/grav-plugin-google-analytics) or via [GetGrav.org](http://getgrav.org/downloads/plugins#extras).

You should now have all the plugin files under

    /your/site/grav/user/plugins/grav-plugin-google-analytics
	
> **Note:** This plugin is a modular component for Grav which may require other plugins to operate, please see its [blueprints.yaml-file on GitHub](https://github.com/cworreschk/grav-plugin-google-analytics/blob/master/blueprints.yaml).

### Admin Plugin

If you use the Admin Plugin, you can install the plugin directly by browsing the `Plugins`-menu and clicking on the `Add` button.

## Configuration

Before configuring this plugin, you should copy the `user/plugins/grav-plugin-google-analytics/google-analytics.yaml` to `user/config/plugins/google-analytics.yaml` and only edit that copy.

Here is the default configuration and an explanation of available options:
